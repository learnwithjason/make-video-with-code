  Make Video With Code (with Jonny Burger)
</h1>
<h3 align="center">
  This app was built live on <em>Learn With Jason</em> and it was super fun and I’m sad you weren’t there.
</h3>
<p align="center">
  But don’t worry! You can still: 
  <a href="https://www.learnwithjason.dev/make-video-with-code"><strong>watch the video</strong></a> · 
  <a href="https://jason.af/lwj/schedule"><strong>see upcoming episodes</strong></a>
</p>

&nbsp;

Making slick, animated video using React might sound far-fetched, but Remotion makes it possible! Jonathan Burger will teach us how.
